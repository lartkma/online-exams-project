Welcome to the business documentation of the **Online Exams System for Schools** (from now on called **the OESS**). This web contains information describing the concepts and components that form this application. It also defines deployment and development guidelines.

## Business brief
> A teacher's job does not end with teaching hours, part of their responsibility is to evaluate his or her students to corroborate learning. In view of the arduous task involved in preparing and correcting exams of different grades and in some cases of different courses, we have found it convenient to develop an application that reduces the effort of the teacher and also improves the learning process.

## Objectives

### General
- Implement an online exams web application for middle and high schoolers.

### Specific
- Ease the work of elaborate, evaluate exams, and record the grades.
- Compile a database of questions from different academic areas, curated and enhanced by teachers, to facilitate and systematize the creation of exams.
